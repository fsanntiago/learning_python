The ability to modify lists is particularly important when you’re working with a list of users on a website or a list of characters in a game. However, sometimes you’ll want to create a list of items that cannot change. Tuples allow you to do just that. Python refers to values that cannot change as *immutable*, and an immutable list is called a *tuple*."
